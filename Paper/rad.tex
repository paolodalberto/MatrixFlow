\begin{abstract}
  Reinforcement algorithms showed there are new algorithms that may
  replace Strassen's original fast matrix multiplication. Probably
  there are even more hidden gems by way of factoring the operand
  matrices. The discovery really jump-started a wave of excitement and
  a flourishing of publications. However, little work on
  implementations and applications.

  Here, we play with no module-2 algorithms and for square matrices
  only. We present {\em Matrix Flow}, this is a simple Python project
  for the automatic formulation, design, implementation, code
  generation, and execution of fast matrix multiplication algorithms
  for CPUs and GPUs.

  In Matrix Flow, we show that we have an original way to combine fast
  algorithms by means of factorizing the operand matrices and prove
  them correct. We describe these algorithm as a Data flow and matrix
  data partitioning: a Directed Acyclic Graph. We show that Strassen's
  original algorithm is still the top choice for modern GPUs. We also
  address error analysis in double precision (integer computations are
  always correct).

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}
The researcher at DeepMind showed a new methodology to find new and
faster matrix multiplication \cite{PMID:36198780}. In practice, there
are already quite a few algorithms for the solution of matrix
multiplication
