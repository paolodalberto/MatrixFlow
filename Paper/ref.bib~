@inproceedings{LiuAESRFB:2016,
title = "SSD: Single shot multibox detector",
abstract = "We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300x300 input, SSD achieves 74.3{\%} mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512 x 512 input, SSD achieves 76.9{\%} mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/ tree/ssd.",

@article{Duarte2019,
title = {FPGAs as a Service to Accelerate Machine Learning Inference},
author = {Duarte, Javier and et al.},
abstractNote = {Large-scale particle physics experiments face
                  challenging demands for high-throughput computing
                  resources both now and in the future. New
                  heterogeneous computing paradigms on dedicated
                  hardware with increased parallelization, such as
                  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), offer
                  exciting solutions with large potential gains. The
                  growing applications of machine learning algorithms
                  in particle physics for simulation, reconstruction,
                  and analysis are naturally deployed on such
                  platforms. We demonstrate that the acceleration of
                  machine learning inference as a web service
                  represents a heterogeneous computing solution for
                  particle physics experiments that requires minimal
                  modification to the current computing model. As
                  examples, we retrain the ResNet-50 convolutional
                  neural network to demonstrate state-of-the-art
                  performance for top quark jet tagging at the LHC,
                  and apply a ResNet-50 model with transfer learning
                  for neutrino event classification. Using Project
                  Brainwave b y Microsoft to accelerate the ResNet-50
                  image classification model, we achieve average
                  inference times of 60 (10) milliseconds with our
                  experimental physics software framework using
                  Brainwave as a cloud (edge or on-premises) service,
                  representing an improvement by a factor of
                  approximately 30 (175) in model inference latency
                  over traditional CPU inference in current
                  experimental hardware. A single FPGA service
                  accessed by many CPUs achieves a throughput of
                  600--700 inferences per second using an image batch
                  of one, comparable to large batch-size GPU
                  throughput and significantly better than small
                  batch-size GPU throughput. Deployed as an edge or
                  cloud service for the particle physics computing
                  model, coprocessor accelerators can have a higher
                  duty cycle and are potentially much more
                  cost-effective.},
