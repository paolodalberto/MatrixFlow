#         original  now
# a terms:    0  =>   0
# b terms:    0  =>   0
# c terms:    4  =>   4

P1 := a11 * b11;
P2 := a12 * b21;
P3 := a11 * b12;
P4 := a12 * b22;
P5 := a21 * b11;
P6 := a22 * b21;
P7 := a21 * b12;
P8 := (- a22) * (- b22);

# Target matrix sums of products:
#
c11 := P1 + P2;
c12 := P3 + P4;
c21 := P5 + P6;
c22 := P7 + P8;
