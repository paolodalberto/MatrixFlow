# Time Series Toys

## Arima

Given a time series, we create an ARIMA model and use it to predict
the next steps and the we can use the estimate and the measure to flag
outliers

## Custom Model

Give a time series x_i, we have a function f(x_i,p) that we know
represents the complexity but we do not exactly the prameters. This is
an example of scipy.optimize.

## 5%
Because this is the way we do. 

## N-to-M sample

Simplified method to take a series L and another M, and create a CDF
we could use to comapre distributions. We create a poset by the
definition of probability in a n-Dimensional space. Then we create a
topological sort by a Breadth first search.  I like the method and
works well for small dimension ... for large dimension we need a lot
of sample to create a meaningful poset.

## Compression

Inspired by Kolmogorov's measure of complexity by compression

(C(AB) -min(C(B),C(A)))/max(C(A),C(B))


## Kernel

This is my firts implementation, outside the C implementation in
FastCDL. The implementation is exactly as the C implementation but a
little more clear and concise. Still I do not understand it...
