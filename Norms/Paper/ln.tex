\begin{abstract}

  Layer Norms are important tools in today's AI systems.  Also, they
  are the little pesky layers that inference-engine tools have often
  problems in either fusing with other layers for speed-up or
  introducing of numerical unwanted oddities.  Norms have linear
  complexity, they are communication bound, they require to read the
  input at least twice, and there is a satisfying asymmetry of the
  computation (i.e., row Gaussian normalization and column scaling).
  
  Here, we formalize the norms using a unified formalism. We do so to
  clarify the general computation, the opportunity to fuse other
  computations, to highlight non obvious properties and give an
  unified computation model. So we can generate consistent and correct
  code for our AIE AMD computes.

\section{A Mathematics First} 
\label{sec:introduction}
Here, we are interested only in matrices $X \in \R^{M \times
  N}$. Together with this paper, there will be code implementing and
compute every expression presented here for matrices.

A matrix norm is composed by two parts. We have a {\em projection}
where we compute a factor, a vector, and then a {\em normalization}
where we take the projected factor and distribute it back. In the
literature and implementations these can take different names:
Projection is often call reduction because it is frequently associated
with sums, dot products. Normalization is often call broadcast because
it is very often based on a Matrix by scalar operations. Now that we
have a name and association to other well known term, let us define
them formally.

\begin{definition}
An associative projection $P_+: \Vc{X}\in\R^{M\times N} \rightarrow
\Vc{F} \in \R^{M}$, is a function where the element $f_i =
\sum_{j=1}^N x_{i,j}$. The $+/\sum$ sign is not in general a
summation, but it is a nice anchor for the associative property we
require: $f_i = (x_{i,1} + (\sum_{j=2}^N x_{i,j})) = ((\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}
x_{i,j}) + x_{i,N}) $.
\end{definition}

Let us digest the formalism a little. We could use a different symbol
but $+$ has inherently a positive influence. As we will read our
matrix, we are going to maintain the order and projecting of matrix
$\Vc{X}$. We do not need the projection to be commutative in general
but all the projection of interests are. Also, in general we may
require the computation of multiple projections. In practice, here we
will present examples with one and two projections.

We abuse the notation of the symbol $+$ in the associative expression
$f_i = (x_{i,1} + (\sum_{j=2}^N x_{i,j}))$, in the sense that the
combination of the temporary sub-projection may require some extra
work during the computation or at the end when we have a complete
projection into a proper normalization factor.

\begin{definition}
  We foresee two Normalization
  \begin{equation}
    N_*: \Vc{X}\in\R^{M\times N}, \Vc{T}\in \R^M \rightarrow \Vc{Y}
    \in \R^{M\times N}, \text{ where } y_{i,j} = x_{i,j}*t_i
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    N_*: \Vc{X}\in\R^{M\times N}, \Vc{S}\in \R^N \rightarrow \Vc{Y}
    \in \R^{M\times N}, \text{ where } y_{i,j} = x_{i,j}*s_j
  \end{equation}
  Again the $*$ is not necessarily a multiplication and the
  normalization can be by row or by column. For presentation purpose
  we will use a single symbol unless it will be confusing.
\end{definition}

We need a scalar operation that we define as it follows.
\begin{definition}
  A scalar operation
  \begin{equation}
    G_f: X \rightarrow Y \text{ and }  y_{i,j} = f(x_{i,j})
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
