\begin{abstract}
The FPGA-AIE is a novel design of systolic architectures with a memory
hierarchy and where communications and computations have to be
designed tightly. We present two tools for the presentation and
implementation of a matrix algebra (*,+) that we call tiling and code
generation.

Tiling is the science of choosing spatial and temporal locality in
order to exploit parallelism and high throughput. As tiling is done,
we represent the computation as a block computation (human
understandable) and then as graph with DMA connections, loop and
tiling information that we can use to create an HW implementation
using FPGA-AIE and in particular the MLADF interface.
