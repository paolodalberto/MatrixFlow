\begin{abstract}
We formalize the following problem: We observe a function execution
during a benchmark and we collect problem sizes and call numbers. Now,
if we can choose a subset of calls to be done in HW (accelerators)
what is the best selection to cover all function calls. 
\end{abstract}




\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:introduction}

We observe the execution of one function during a benchmark. We can
summarize the benchmark observation by a list
\begin{equation}
  A = \{ [s_i, n_i, c_i] \mbox{ with } i \in [0,N-1] \}
\end{equation}
We consider all inputs and outputs as one dimensional array. The
cardinality of the list is $\|A\| = N$. Where $s_i$ is the size of the
input problem, $n_i$ is the number of time we call the function for
this problem size, and $c_i$ is the cost. In practice, we give a cost
as the number of padding we need to introduce to execute this function
in HW. We initialize the cost by a large number say $10^9$.

We want to find a set $P\subset A$, where we can execute the function
on such input in HW and thus with cost 0. Then, $\forall [s_i,
  n_i,c_i] \in A, \exists [p_j,n_j,0] \in P^* $ such that $c_i =
n_i(p_j -s_i)$.  We imply that there is an extension $p_j$ that is
larger than $s_i$ and we shall explain in the next section.

  

\section{Solution Formulation}
Here, we assume that all sets have indices and we imply an increasing
order by size of the problem.
\begin{equation}
  P \subset A \rightarrow \{ p_i = [ s_i,n_i,0 ]\}, \forall s_i \leq s_{N-1}
\end{equation}
We do not really need to choose elements of $A$, but it is reasonable
to start with functions that are used.

Take a $p_i =[s_i, n_i,0]$ and create the following extension:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    p_i^*  \rightarrow   \{ & p_i = [ ks_i,0,0 ], \\
    & \forall k \in [1, M]  \mbox{ s.t. } s_i(M-1)< s_{N-1}< s_iM \\
    &\mbox{ and } [s_i*k,*,*] \not \in P\\
    &\}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
If we lay $A$ into a straight line and thus $p_i^*$, we create a step
of computations that can use the HW call $p_i$ directly. There is some
extra costs for this but we do not count them. Thus the full extension
of the HW calls is:
\begin{equation}
  P^* = \cup_ip_i^*
\end{equation}
We are going to merge $A$ and $P^*$ and sort them by size to create
$A^*$. We artificially increased the number of entries. We can now
define the cost of using $P$ hardware function in calling all function
calls in $A$. 

Cost is  $\sum_i c_i, a_i = [s_i,n_i,c_i] \in A^*$
\begin{equation}
  c_i =
  \begin{cases}
     0, & \text{if } c_i==0 \\
     n_i*(s_j-s_i), & \text{where } j = min_{k>0}(i+k) \mbox{ s.t. }c_j==0  
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
